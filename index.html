				<p class="project_text" style="margin-top: 0px; opacity: 1;">Invisible Ink was a simple <em>library</em> that will take specified text and "ink" it out, making it unreadable until hovered upon. It has quite a few applicable uses, like for
					hiding <span class="ink">spoilers</span> and <span class="ink">security words</span>. It was inspired by one of iOS 10's new features for iMessages.</p>
